## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend** (React + Vite)
   - User interface for meeting interactions
   - WebRTC peer connection management
   - Real-time video/audio streaming

2. **Signaling Server**
   - Manages WebSocket connections
   - Handles WebRTC signaling
   - Facilitates peer discovery and connection

3. **Meeting Server**
   - Manages meeting creation and scheduling
   - Handles participant tracking
   - Integrates with Firebase for data persistence

4. **Room Manager**
   - Controls room allocation
   - Tracks room availability
   - Manages concurrent meeting sessions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Firebase account and project
- SSL certificates for HTTPS (included in `/ssl` folder for development)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/userjaggu/online-meeting-web-application"
   cd Online-Meeting-WebApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase 🔥:**
   - Update Firebase configuration in `src/fire_auth.jsx` and `firestore_Database.cjs`

   - Please follow the 🕮 [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for more information about setting up firebase auth.

4. **Start the application:**

   Start all required servers (in separate terminals):

   ```bash
   # Start the frontend development server
   npm run dev

   # Start the signaling server
   npm run signalling

   # Start the meeting server
   npm run meeting

   # Start the room manager server
   npm run room_manager
   ```
